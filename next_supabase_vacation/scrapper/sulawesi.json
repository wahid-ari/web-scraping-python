The beach is located in the northernmost part of Sulawesi and is just 48 km away from Manado, specifically in a district called Likupang.</p>\n<p>From the first time you lay eyes on Likupang Beach, you will be stunned by its marvelous and vast white sandy beach.

The presence of a rare species like this is a sign that the ocean ecosystem of Northern Sulawesi is in a good condition. Due to these clear waters, it is a favorite place for people to dive and snorkel in.</p>\n<p>Paradise Water Sports at the Casabaio Paradise Resort is a beloved tourist attraction near the beach. Like the game show \u201cNinja Warrior\u201d, where you can jump on trampolines that are right on the surface of the water! Therefore, if you fall, you dive into the beautiful blue waters. Not only do you get to jump around for fun, but you can also choose from a wide range of water sports like jet skis, banana boat, and many others.</p>\n<h2><b>Interesting Place Nearby</b></h2>\n<p>There are several beaches around Likupang that you might want to visit such as Pal Beach and Pulisan Beach. The beach along the bay is usually used as a spot for diving, especially by international travelers.
