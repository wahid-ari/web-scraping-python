Here also are many typical Java trees like the Java tamarind and the pecan nut trees.</p>\n<p>Discovered by Dutchman A.H.Loredeboer, in 1937 it was designated Wildlife Refuge by the Dutch colonial authorities, and in 1980 Indonesia designated this as a National Park. At the center of this large Park stands the extinct Baluran volcano, watching over its pristine environment dominated by the dry east wind, Baluran receives on average only 3 months of rain. The rainy season in East Java being between Novembers through April, peaking in December and January, while the dry season lasts from April through October.</p>\n<p>During the dry season, the land parches and water becomes scarce, while when it rains, water slides over the black alluvial land with little being absorbed, forming water pools especially along the Park\u2019s southern part that connects Talpat with Bama Beach. When you visit Baluran during the rainy season, you will see ample water holes, but during this time the Banteng and the wild bulls prefer to wander in the forests, although other animals like peacocks, mouse deer, and wildfowl do come out and can still be observed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/revamp-image/baluran-national-park/deer.jpg\" width=\"500\"/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Baluran National Park boasts 444 species of trees, some unique to the area like the widoro bukol (<i>Ziziphus rotundifolia</i>), mimba (<i>Azadirachta indica</i>), and pilang (<i>Acacia leucophloea</i>).

Merapi near Yogyakarta) and the Ijen volcano.</p>\n<p>From Surabaya driving via the northern coastal road east you will pass the towns of Pasuruan, Probolinggo, and Situbondo.

It is believed that these temples used to serve as residences of Hindu priests who would spread Hindu teachings.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"temple\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/dieng-plateau/temple.jpg\" width=\"500\"/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>The Two Colorful Lakes</h2>\n<p>The natural splendors of this location are fascinating. From lakes with green and yellow hues called Telaga Warna to the pristine waters of the reflective \u2018mirror\u2019 lake called Telaga Pengilon, the natural beauty of this spot is superb. The mirror lake is particularly impressive as it offers a perfectly reflective image of the landscape.\u00a0 While, the impact of logging can be seen as many of the trees surrounding the lake have been cut down, it still remains an impressive natural phenomenon.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"lake\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/dieng-plateau/lake.jpg\" width=\"500\"/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve walked to the top of the Dieng plateau you will feel like you are on top of the world. It will be difficult to know just where to look as the view from the plateau takes in steaming and colorful lakes, ancient temples and lush green landscape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>How to Get There</h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re coming from Jakarta, Semarang, or Surabaya, the first thing you need to do is to reach Wonosobo either by train or bus since both are convenient and available anytime. Head to Mendolo Terminal in Wonosobo and then find a public minibus transportation called Mikromini for a ride straight to Dieng Plateau. Mikromini is always available in Mendolo Terminal everyday from 8.00 AM to 5.00 PM local time and the ride is just 1,5 - 2 hours away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>How to Get Around</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no better way to explore Dieng Plateau than on foot. However, if you\u2019re looking for a quick method of hopping from one place to another, many locals provide motorcycle rides at affordable rates.</p>\n<p>There are many things you can do in the Dieng Plateau. For a truly amazing spectacle, arrive at the plateau at sunrise and you will be spoiled with not one, but two amazing views of the sunrise, a \u2018golden\u2019 and a \u2018silver\u2019 sunrise. This double sunrise is a unique natural phenomenon.\u00a0 Visitors take in the first \u2018golden\u2019 sunrise from a watch tower while the second \u2018silver\u2019 sunrise can be seen from the temples.</p>\n<p>Even the drive to the plateau offers impressive sights. On the way up, visitors will pass through tobacco plantations and beautiful mountain scenery.</p>\n<p>The Dieng people are used to visitors and warmly welcome travellers to the region.</p>\n</p>"

The air around Ijen Crater normally will reach about 10 degrees celsius daily. Sometimes, it might even hit 2 degrees celsius. In the day, the mesmerizing sight of sunlight radiating a turquoise lake enveloped with smokes will give you an everlasting impression. Several small vents can be found surrounding the crater. They are a source of work for sulfur miners, making their way up and down from the crater and down to the lake each and every day. At dawn, you can have a chance to witness an incredible natural phenomenon where blue-tinted flames will appear around the crater.

Once you\u2019ve arrived at Paltuding Post, you can trek your way up to the edge of the Ijen crater caldera through a 3 km long route. The daily climbing schedule starts at 01:00 AM up until 12:00 AM. However, during the restriction period, the climbing schedule will instead start at 03:00 AM.</p>\n</p>"

    "content": "<h1>Demak</h1><p class=\"fs-6 border-top fw-light\">\n<h2>The History of the Islamic Sultanate in Java</h2>\n<p>Sandwiched between Semarang, capital of Central Java to its west, the regency of Jepara to its north, and the regency of Kudus to the east, the town of Demak was the seat of the once-powerful Demak Sultanate, the cradle from where Islam spread throughout the entire island of Java.</p>\n<p>According to \u201cThe Soil of East-Central Java\u201d written by T.W.G Dames in 1955, approximately 6 centuries ago, the area where now stands the town of Demak was then a coastline facing the Silugangga Channel that separated the main island of Java from the then Muria Island (present-day Jepara and Kudus). Thus, the town was a busy harbor with trade connections to Malacca and the Spice Islands of east Indonesia.</p>\n<p>Around the 15th Century, the channel was sufficiently wide and became an important waterway for ships sailing along the northern Javanese coast to the Spice Islands. The channel was also connected to the Serang River, which enabled access to the rice-producing interior of Java. This strategic location enabled Demak to rise as a leading trading center in Java. However, since the 17th century, the channel silted up, shallowed, and eventually vanished completely, thus merging the island of Muria with mainland Java.</p>\n<p>The founding of the Demak Sultanate was traditionally attributed to Raden Patah (1475\u20131518), a Javanese nobleman related to the once-powerful Majapahit king of East Java. At least one account stated that Raden Patah was, in fact, the son of Kertabhumi, who reigned as king Brawijaya V of Majapahit (1468\u20131478). Demak managed to consolidate its power and defeated Daha in 1527 because it was more widely accepted as the legitimate successor to Majapahit. The reason for this acceptance was because Raden Patah was believed to be a direct descendant of Kertabhumi who survived the invasion by Girindrawardana on Trowulan, capital of Majapahit, in 1478.</p>\n<p>With the full support of the Wali Songo or the Nine Apostles of Islam, the Demak Sultanate rose to become the most prominent Islamic kingdom on Java and the center in the spread of Islam in Java.</p>\n<p>The symbol of the golden era of the Demak Sultanate and the early spread of Islam in Java still stands today, which is the Masjid Agung Demak or the Great Mosque of Demak.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"agung\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/agung.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2><b>The Great Mosque of Demak</b></h2>\n<p>Built in 1478, the Great Mosque of Demak is believed to be the first mosque in Java and one of the oldest in Indonesia. Constructed collectively by the Wali Songo and Raden Patah as the first ruler of the Demak Sultanate, the mosque holds great significance as it was not merely a place for prayers but at the time was also the center of the sultan\u2019s governance and the venue where the walis (apostles) used to meet to discuss matters.</p>\n<p>Although the Mosque has undergone a number of renovations, it is thought to have largely remained in its original form. The mosque is a classic example of the traditional Javanese mosque. Unlike mosques in the Middle East, this one was built of timber without a dome, which only appeared on Indonesian mosques by the 19th century. The tiered roof shows many similarities to the wooden religious structures from the Hindu-Buddhist civilizations on Java and Bali.</p>\n<p>The main entrance of the Great Mosque of Demak consists of two doors carved with motifs of plants, vases, crowns and an animal head with a wide-open fanged mouth. It is said that the picture depicts the manifested thunder caught by Ki Ageng Selo, hence their name \u201cLawang Bledheg\u201d or \u201cthe doors of thunder.\u201d</p>\n<p><img alt=\"mosque\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/great-mosque.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>The historical and legendary parts of the mosque are the large four main wooden pillars, called the soko guru, that support the heavy wooden roof of the mosque. With each pillar carved out of single trees with a height reaching 16 meters, the four main pillars are placed according to the four cardinal directions and were set up by members of the Wali Songo. The Northwest Pillar was erected by Sunan Bonang, the Southwest by Sunan Gunung Jati, the South East by Sunan Ampel, and the very exceptional pillar known as Soko Tatal which is constructed from joined pieces of wood scrap and erected on the northeast by Sunan Kalijaga. The original four soko guru were replaced with replicas in 1983 and the originals are now placed in the museum in the mosque compound.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"forpilar\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/forpilar.jpg\" width=\"500\"/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>The tomb of Sunan Kalijaga located in the village of Kadilangu approximately 2 kilometers from the Mosque is another legacy from the early Javanese Islamic era frequently visited by visitors and pilgrims. Every year during the \u201cGrebeg Besar\u201d ritual ceremony (which falls on 10 Dzulhijah of the Islamic Calendar) when various heirlooms are ritually cleansed, thousands of visitors and pilgrims flock to Demak to take part in the event.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2><b>How to Get There</b></h2>\n<p>Demak lies on the main north coast highway \u2013 known as Pantura \u2013 between Central Java and East Java, connecting Semarang with Surabaya.\u00a0 The town of Demak is only 25 Kilometers or about 30-40 minutes\u2019 drive from Semarang, capital of Central Java. There is also a lot of public transportation available in Semarang or intercity buses that pass through Demak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>How to Get Around</h2>\n<p>Demak also has a lot of public transportation for you to get around, but we suggest you rent a car or motorcycle for a convenient way to go anywhere you want. Aside from the Great Mosque of Demak and the Tomb of Sunan Kalijaga, there are many other attractions that you must explore. Head to Sayung District and you will find Morosari Beach: a mangrove coastline with unexpectedly stunning scenery, especially at sunset. If you\u2019re looking for a delectable seafood cuisine, come to Tirangan Beach in Babalan Village in the early evening and you will be treated with a range of seafood dishes made with newly-captured sea products by the local fishermen.</p>\n</p>"

    "content": "<h1>Semarang: The Venice of Java</h1><p>Semarang: The Venice of Java</p><p class=\"fs-6 border-top fw-light\">\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heart of Central Java, Semarang, with its multicultural history would be the best city for those who love exploring cities with diverse cultural heritage. It\u2019s also one of the largest metropolitan cities in Indonesia, and provides so many compelling itineraries for you to visit.</p>\n<p>Semarang is traversed by many rivers in the middle of the city just like Venice in Italy, thus Netherland ever called this city as <i>Veneti\u00eb van Java </i>or The Venice of Java. This city is also known as<i> Kota Lumpia </i>or Lumpia City. Lumpia is one of the most delicious snacks you could ever find in Indonesia. It\u2019s a snack born by acculturation of two cultures, Javanese and Chinese, and a typical food from Semarang.</p>\n<p>As one of the huge cities in Indonesia, Semarang is never deserted by tourists all over the world. Let\u2019s learn more about the reasons why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>History of Semarang</h3>\n<p>In the 15th century, Chinese emperor\u2019s emissary Zheng He, otherwise known as Admiral Cheng Ho, set foot on Java. From the 17th century onwards, Semarang became an entrepot for spices, also a busy harbor for trade and passengers when travel was made predominantly by sea. The city of Semarang, capital of the province of Central Java, sits precisely in the center of the northern seaboard of the fertile and densely populated island of Java.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"semarang\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/kotalamarevamp.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>This strategic position of Semarang has made the city a melting pot of Chinese, Indian Arab, and European cultures. Wander around the Chinese quarters and the Dutch commercial district, you will see the influences of different cultures everywhere. In the older part of the city near the harbor named Kota Lama, or the Oudstadt, stroll around to explore the historic old buildings in what was once the European commercial district.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>What to Do</h3>\n<p>With so many countries sailing to Semarang during those old times, no wonder we can feel the charming old-time <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/semarang-old-town-charming-old-time-heritage-atmosphere\">heritage atmosphere</a> around the city. These buildings are also influenced by the European style of architecture and also old Chinese architecture style.</p>\n<p>Here is a list you must stop by when you visit Semarang;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0 \u00a0The Iconic Blenduk Church</h3>\n<p>The most renowned landmark to see here is the Koepelkerk, a Pantheon style church, locally known as Gereja Blenduk, a copper-domed Dutch church dating from 1753.\u00a0</p>\n<p><img alt=\"semarang\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/benculukrevamp.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3>2.\u00a0 \u00a0Brown Canyon</h3>\n<p>Another tourist gem you should consider when you visit Semarang is <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/15-summer-signature-experience-in-the-cities-of-yogya-solo-semarang\">Brown Canyon</a>, located in Rowosari. This landmark showcases its majestic sandy brown cliffs with greenery spread throughout the area. The Brown Canyon's panoramic scenery has brought attention among professional and amateur photographers as it offers similar nuance as the Grand Canyon in America.</p>\n<p>Though originally created for mining, this site has naturally eroded throughout the years, creating a unique structure. Those who are interested to visit this site should consider exploring during the weekends, as it will be filled with workers during workdays.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0 \u00a0The historical Lawang Sewu</h3>\n<p>Lawang sewu is another historical building in Semarang. Lawang sewu is originally from Javanese language which means building with thousand doors. During the colonial era, this building was used as the headquarters of the Dutch East Indies railway company. Many people believe that this building is haunted and often visited by ghost hunters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0 \u00a0Sam Poo Kong Temple Complex</h3>\n<p>Sam poo kong is a historical destination built to reminisce Admiral Cheng Ho, a Muslim explorer originating from china. The temple was built in the 15th century and marked as the oldest Chinese temple in Simongan, Semarang.</p>\n<p>The best time to visit this temple is on the sixth month in the lunar calendar. During that time a festival will be held to commemorate the arrival of admiral Cheng Ho in Semarang. One of the most awaited events is when the people parading the statue of Cheng Ho from Tay Kak Sie temple to Sam Poo Kong. Also, during the auspicious days in the lunar calendar or historical omens in Cheng Ho\u2019s history, there will be festivals and celebrations held in front of the yard of the temple.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>5.\u00a0 \u00a0Semawis Night Market</h3>\n<p>If you visit Semarang during the weekend, then a visit to Semawis night market is a must. This area of night market is also known as the Chinatown of Semarang. Located in Gang Warung, Semarang, this night market sells a variety of mouth watering Indonesian and Chinese influenced foods and drinks.</p>\n<p>The area which is also known by the locals as Waroeng Semawis was established in 2004 to memorialise the 600 years of Cheng Ho\u2019s first expedition in Semarang. You can simply say this night market is a food street heaven since it is lined with street hawkers of satays, fried rice, soup, noodles, desserts and you could possibly find Semarang specialities such as Pisang Plenet and Lumpia.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>6.\u00a0 \u00a0Semarang Iconic\u2019s snacks</h3>\n<p>It will not be complete when you visit any place without trying their local foods and drinks. Semarang is one of the cities where you can fill your cravings for the good foods which will make you want to dig in more and more.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"semarang\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/semarang/semarang-the-venice-of-java/risol.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>For a complete culinary experience, the Pasar Semawis Culinary Center in Gang Warung is truly a must. Most of the food here is different to what you'll find elsewhere. Here a number of stalls sell mouthwatering dishes with pork in them \u2013 a rarity anywhere on Java.</p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><b>Get Around</b></h3>\n<p>In Semarang, taxi is everywhere. Small buses are visible going by the city streets. They go to different parts of the city. You might want to ask the locals before taking one of those city buses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Becak\u00a0or rickshaw (trishaw) is a pleasant choice to feel the breeze in Semarang while you enjoy the city scenes. When visiting Kota Lama, take one of those\u00a0becaks, and enjoy the relaxing ride.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><b>Get There</b></h3>\n<p>Semarang is accessible by air and land. Its strategic location does not make it so difficult to get there. Many domestic airlines fly to Semarang from Jakarta and Surabaya. From Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, approximately 1 hour to Semarang airport and from Surabaya to Semarang the estimated flight time is 1 hour 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta\">Jakarta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/bandung\">Bandung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/surabaya\">Surabaya</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/malang\">Malang</a>, trains are available as well as buses and rented cars.

    "content": "<h1>Purwakarta</h1><p>An Enchanting Window on Sunda Culture</p><p class=\"fs-6 border-top fw-light\">\n<p>Strategically situated between the capital city of <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jakarta</a></u> and West Java\u2019s capital, <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/bandung.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bandung</a></u> , Purwakarta Regency was once better known as an industrial area. However, over time Purwakarta has grown into an attractive destination in its own right that showcases its authentic identity as the cultural window to the Sunda ethnic group\u2019s way of life of the people of West Java.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>According to Old Sunda Language of West Java, the name Purwakarta is derived from the word <i>Purwa</i> meaning \u2018the beginning/the origin\u2019 and \u2018<i>Karta</i>\u2019 meaning \u2018lively/active\u2019, hence Purwakarta loosely means \u2018a lively place since ancient times\u2019. Purwakarta's existence is inseparable from the nation\u2019s history in the fight against the colonial forces of the<i>Vereenigde Oostindische</i> <i>Compagnie</i> (VOC) or the Dutch East India Company who occupied the region around the 17th century. The regency then played the role as the main logistics base for the Javanese Mataram Kingdom during their attack on the VOC\u2019s controlled Batavia (present day Old Jakarta). In turn, Purwakarta\u2019s rich agricultural resources were later also utilized by the victorious Dutch Colonial Forces.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Remnants of the Dutch colonial era still decorate many parts of Purwakarta. These can be seen especially found in downtown Purwakarta where heritage sites are transformed into some of the town\u2019s most impressive landmarks.</p>\n<p>The most iconic of these is the <b>Sri Baduga Fountain Park</b> at Situ Buleud or the \u2018Round Lake\u2019 situated right in the heart of town, which is in fact an artificial lake that was originally built during Dutch Colonial times and meant as a pool for a herd of the now near-extinct rhinoceros population.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>This small lake has now been transformed into the largest Fountain Park in Southeast, called the Sri Baduga Fountain Park, which boasts a 3 hectares sprawling park with at its center musical and dancing fountains using state-of-the-art technology. Here, in its center among the hundreds of dancing fountains sits majestically the statue of Prabu Kian Santang, son of Prabu Siliwangi, also known as Sri Baduga, the most famous Maharaja who ruled ancient Pajajaran. Surrounding the statue, no less than 2,000 water spouts shoot up showers that dance following synchronized music. And enhanced by streams of light in rainbow colors and laser play, they form images of a man and a woman dancing special Sundanese traditional dances.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Located not too far from the Sri Baduga Fountain Park, there is another historical building believed to have been builtin the 19th century called <i><b>Gedung Kembar</b></i> or literally meaning \u2018The Twin Building\u2019. Today, one of the buildings is used as a unique Museum named <b>Bale Panyawangan Diorama Museum</b>. Loosely translated, Bale Panyawangan means \u2018A Place to Gaze\u2019. As the name suggests, here is the perfect place to observe not only into the history of Purwakarta but also of the great Sunda kingdom of Pajajaran, and its culture. Uniquely, the museum does not only feature conventional collections but it is also completed with various digital displays. In one of these, visitors can take a virtual tour of Purwakarta on an actual antique bicycle.</p>\n<div><div><img alt=\"An Enchanting Window on Sunda Culture\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/west-java/purwakarta/69d650966c3bd0acb644d1555d565bd25967fcfa-3236e.jpg\"><br/>\r\nImage by <a href=\"http://aryanugrahasoepardi.blogspot.co.id/2016/03/kawasan-wisata-grama-tirta-jatiluhur_9.html\" target=\"_blank\">Arya Nugraha</a></img></div>\n</div>\n<p>For those who wish to enjoy watersports such as canoeing, water skiing, wind surfing, and many others, Purwakarta has the <b>Grama Tirta Jatiluhur </b>or the Jatiluhur Waterpark which is built along the Jatiluhur Dam. Here, not only you can have various activities, you can also enjoy the spectacular scenery of Jatiluhur Dam and Lake.

Here is the beautiful <b>Wanayasa Lake </b>among lush hills surrounding Mount Burangrang. There is also the <b>Cipurut Waterfall </b>and the <b>Cidomas River</b> which make perfect getaways from the hustle and bustle of daily city life.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re up for a little bit of adventure, go trek and hike to some of the challenging trails up <b>Mount Lembu, Mount Parang, Mount Cupu, and Mount Bangkok.</b><br/>\n</p>\n<p>While you are in Purwakarta, don\u2019t forget to taste the Purwakarta specialty of <b>Sate Maranggi</b>, a signature dish of the regency that has become a favorite food of many Indonesians. Made of Lamb or beef, what makes Sate Maranggi different from other sate/satay or meat skewers is that before they are barbequed, the meat for sate maranggi is marinated in various herbs and spices that give it its distinct taste. Sate Maranggi is normally served with fresh cut tomato slices, shallots and a (very hot) spicy sauce.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Check out more Information on Purwakarta at: <a href=\"http://purwakarta-tourism.com/\" target=\"Target\">http://purwakarta-tourism.com/</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

It is less known that surrounding the breathtaking beauty of Borobudur, Magelang is, in fact, a regency filled with a whole range of fascinating splendor that promises the perfect vacation experience.</p>\n<p>Situated between\u00a0<b>Mount Merbabu</b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>Mount Sumbing</b>\u00a0and coursed by the meandering streams of the Progo and Elo Rivers, Magelang is blessed with picturesque natural surroundings, perfect for those who wish to breathe in Central Java's greener side.</p>\n<p>The earliest known records of Magelang city date back to the year 907, when it was established as a village under the Old Mataram Kingdom. Further down in history, Magelang once was made into a military post by the Dutch East Indies colonial government. Among remnants of this era is the 1918 Water Tower that still stands to this very day. The regency later acted as an army stronghold for Indonesia's pro-independence movement against the Dutch during the resistance period. Currently, it is host to two military landmarks: The Indonesian National Military Academy, and the military-associated school, Taruna Nusantara.<br/>\n</p>\n<h2><b>What to See and Do in Magelang<br/>\n</b></h2>\n<p>The Magnificent\u00a0<b>Borobudur Temple</b>, a UNESCO inscribed World Heritage site, and pride of Indonesia, is definitely the ultimate attraction in Magelang. Sitting majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills, the Borobudur temple is acknowledged as the world's largest Buddhist monument, an ancient site widely considered as one of the world's seven wonders. Since it is located near Yogyakarta, most people do not realize that the temple is actually located in the Magelang Regency, which is part of the Central Java Province and not in the province of Yogyakarta.</p>\n<p>Not too far from the Borobudur Temple, - for those who are looking for some adrenalin pumping actions - should try the splashing sensation of\u00a0<b>Rafting down the Elo and Progo Rivers</b>, in the Mungkid Area. The rafting adventure at Elo River will take you about 12 km downstream, or roughly 3 hours. The raft falls in the grade II-III category, suitable for beginners and intermediate level rafters. But those looking for more challenging rides should head to the Progo River, which is in the Grade III + difficulty, covering about 15 km of river length. The two rivers not only offer a challenging journey, but also beautiful natural scenery along the rafting course.</p>\n<p>For the most spectacular natural panorama, you should take the\u00a0<b>Ketep Pass</b>\u00a0and immerse yourself in one of the best views of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/inspiration/travel-info/climb-majestic-mt-merapi-volcano-at-the-center-of-java.html\"><b>Mount Merapi</b></a>\u00a0from a comfortable distance. Located some 32 km off Magelang city center, the Ketep Pass is located on a shoulder, bridging Mount Merapi with\u00a0<b>Mt.Merbabu</b>, and is located on the summit of the Sawangan Mountain, about 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>\n<p>Here you can also check out the Ketep Volcano Theater which plays a documentary on Merapi's volcanic activities over the years, or the Ketep Volcano Center which documents volcanic facts and samples of rocks from Merapi's recent eruptions. From the highest viewing point on Ketep Pass, stand amazed by the spectacular sweeping view of five surrounding mountains: the Merapi, Merbabu, <b>Sindoro, Sumbing, and Slamet</b>.</p>\n<p>While you are in the city of Magelang, do not miss the <b>OHD Museum</b> at Jalan Jenggolo Street, which presents a unique realm of contemporary and modern art. The OHD Museum is a private museum on modern and contemporary Indonesian art, founded and owned by one of the most renowned art collectors in Indonesia, Dr. Oei Hong Djien (OHD), who started his collection in the 1970s. Currently, with Dr. Oei's collection of more than 2,000 artworks, ranging from paintings, sculptures, installations and new media art,the OHD Museum provides a collection that represents the essence of modern and contemporary Indonesian art.

Here you can enjoy the gurgling sound of the falls, inhale cool refreshing air and the lush green surroundings that together make this the perfect getaway from the humdrum of daily life.</p>\n<p>The waterfall is believed to be the site of the well known Javanese folktale of\u00a0<b>Jaka Tarub</b>\u00a0which tells the story of seven beautiful angels who came down to earth from heaven. In these falls they decided to take a bath and splashed around the waterfall. The story has it that a local villager by the name of Jaka Tarub snatched the attire of one of the angels while she was bathing, thereby forcing her to stay on earth and eventually marry him.</p>\n<p>Another heritage site of Magelang is\u00a0<b>Candi Umbul</b>\u00a0or\u00a0<b>Umbul Temple</b>\u00a0which is an ancient hot spring bathing pool believed to have been built around the 9th century. A number of stone ruins around the pool depict various reliefs of plants, animals, as well as the Stupa of the Borobudur Temple. The pool is filled with water from a nearby spring and is still used for bathing, to this very day.</p>\n<p>So, when you are on holiday in Yogya or Semarang, why not spend some time in Magelang and bathe in its enticing natural beauty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

During the day, the number increases with commuters making their way to work in the city and flock out again in the evenings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLocated on the northwest of Java Island, the province of DKI Jakarta has rapidly expanded through the years, absorbing many villages in the process. In fact, Jakarta is a conglomeration of villages known as <i>kampung</i>, now crossed by main roads and superhighways.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A City that Never Sleeps\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/Image1.jpg\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<h2>The Charm of the Metropolis<br/>\n</h2>\n<p>A part of the local experience is that you may drive down one wide avenue one minute, then suddenly find yourself squeezed into a small street together with scores of cars and motorbikes. With its many suburbs, Jakarta has become a<a href=\"http://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/jakarta-indonesia-s-capital-of-splendors\">\u00a0Megapolitan city</a>.

The other is the smaller Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, which is reserved for limited domestic flights.\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>Overland</b><br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the nation\u2019s capital, Jakarta is connected by land to major cities in Java, public transport to get to Jakarta is available by bus and train.</p>\n<p>People who visit Jakarta, usually take time to stop by the neighboring Bogor, famous for it's Botanical Garden and highlands getaway in the Puncak area.</p>\n<p>Or if you prefer the coastal area, head to Banten and spend a holiday at Anyer and Carita Beach.</p>\n<p><b>By Sea\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\r\nTanjung Priok is the name of Jakarta\u2019s seaport, located in North Jakarta.

A delightful choice for the one who wants to splurge aboard a luxurious cruise ship.</p>\n<h2><br/>\r\nGet Around</h2>\n<p>The best way to travel around Jakarta is by rented car, taxi or package tour. Be prepared though to meet traffic jams, especially when traveling during peak hours and into business districts, including the Old Batavia area.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is advisable therefore to choose a hotel near the location where you will have your meeting or business appointments or to the attraction or destination you wish to visit. Distances between points of interest in Jakarta can sometimes be far and might be interspersed with traffic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Nusa Kambangan is the Alcatraz of Indonesia. This island is a secured prison for renowned criminals, political prisoners, drug traffickers, terrorists and those convicted in high profile corruption cases.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"nusa kambangan\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-all-destination-s-image/nusa_kambangan.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Historically, during the Dutch colonization period in the 16th century, VOC built a fortress in Nusa Kambangan. It was initially meant as a lookout frontline to protects their ships from potential dangers and pirates. When it can no longer be served to guard the island, VOC then began transforming the fort into a high-security prison to exile criminals and political dissidents.</p>\n<p>Its use as a prison island continues after independence and onto this day. A total of 9 prisons was constructed during the period of 1908-1950; <i>The Permisan, Karang Anyar, Nirbaya, Batu, Besi, Gliger, Karang Tengah, Limus Buntu and Kembang Kuning.</i> Each prison was to house around 700 inmates. Today, there are only four prisons operates with each distinct level of security (Permisan, Batu, Besi and Kembang Kuning).</p>\n<p>The island was opened as a tourist destination in 1996. A special agency was established to manage tourism on the island. All of the tourists should be arranged by the agency and accompanied by security officers until a maximum of 6 PM without an overnight stay. You will also need a special permit from the local police office to enter the island.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"nusa kambangan\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-all-destination-s-image/ranca_babakan.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Aside from the daunting reputation of being an outcast island, the beauty of its natural wildlife is mesmerizing. Nusa Kambangan translates as \u201cthe flower island\u201d because it is said to be a sanctuary of the graceful Wijaya Kusuma flowers (Epiphyllum oxypetalum). It is unique fragrant flowers that bloom once a year in less than a few minutes at night before her petals started to fall.</p>\n<p>The rare trees of Plahlar Wood (Dipterocarpus litoralis) are indigenous of this island, but sadly oftentimes stolen to be dried due to its\u2019 equal quality to Borneo\u2019s meranti wood. Many rare and distinct animals are also reported to live under the shades of its thick forest.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>The island consists of two areas, the east, and west. The western part is where most prisons are located. It also has amazing pristine beaches like Permisan Beach with its\u2019 beautiful white gray sands near the Permisan Prison. There is also Ranca Babakan stretch on the west coast part, glorious Pasir Putih Beach, and several natural caves such as Goa Ratu.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>The eastern part is more accessible. You can go to Teluk Penyu Beach and some locals will offer you a boat trip across the narrow channel. When you are done exploring the island, they will pick you up on the agreed schedule and take you back to Teluk Penyu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"nusa kambangan\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-all-destination-s-image/teluk_penyu.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>The east area beaches are Karang Tengah, Karang Pandan, and Karang Bandung. You can also explore the remains of the Dutch fortress with many mysteries. There are also some attractive cultural events called Sedekah Laut or the sea offerings, which held on every Satu Suro, the first day of the Javanese calendar.</p>\n<p><span>Get There</span></p>\n<p>Nusa Kambangan is separated from the main Java Island by the narrow Segara Anakan strait. To reach this island, you must first get to Cilacap. The nearest airport will be the Tunggul Wulung Airport, 9 km from the city center. Susi Air served this route from Jakarta\u2019s Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. Once in Cilacap, drive to Lo Manis Harbour to ride on a 5 minutes journey on official ferry runs by the Department of Justice towards Nusa Kambangan\u2019s Sodong Harbour.</p>\n<p><span>Get Around</span></p>\n<p>It is best to go around the island by car or minibus as groups. Exploring on foot is not recommended due to many wildlife animals from the surrounding forest. Motorcycle and local public transport are available only in several spots for you to ride along.<br/>\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<h2><b>Where To Stay</b></h2>\n<p>There are no accommodation or camping sites allowed on the island, so the best way is to settle in Cilacap. Favehotel Cilacap offers you a modern style hotel on a very strategic place only a walk distance from Teluk Penyu beach. This hotel has swimming pools and a viewing deck at the rooftop. It has good service, good food and comfortable bedrooms sets in a chic ambiance.</p>\n<p>Favehotel Cilacap</p>\n<p><i>Jalan Budi Utomo No 38, Cilacap, Central Java, 53212</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Visitors who have an eager interest in volcanic activities must come to the park and witness the smoke of ashes coming from Mount Semeru, an active volcano that rises 3,676 meters above sea level.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"bromo\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/bromo1.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park is the only conservation area in Indonesia that has a 10 km sea of sand called Tengger, from which four new volcanic cones have emerged. Those volcanic cones are Mount Batok (2,470 m), Mount Kursi (2,581 m), Mount Watangan (2,661 m), and Mount Widodaren (2,650 m). However, Mount Bromo is still the only one that is active. Temperatures at the top of Mount Bromo range about 5-18 degrees Celsius. Heading south of the park is a rolling upland plateau divided by valleys and decorated with several scenic lakes reaching to the foot of Mount Semeru.</p>\n<h2>Get There</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>By Air</b></p>\n<p>You can fly with Sriwijaya Air, which flies twice daily to Malang from Jakarta. There are also many flights from airlines such as Citilink and Batik Air that fly daily from Jakarta to Surabaya.</p>\n<p><b>By Land</b></p>\n<p>There are multiple ways to get into the park. Visitors can come from Probolinggo through the village of Ngadisari. They can also take the north east approach via Pasuruan through the village of Tosari. The third, which is a more difficult approach, is via Ngadas.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>The Probolinggo approach is the easiest and by far the most popular route, especially if the visitors are traveling by public bus. Wonokitri is the closest and the easiest approach if you are coming by private vehicle from Surabaya (5 hours journey). Once you arrive at those villages, you have to rent 4x4 vehicles in order to get closer to Mount Bromo.</p>\n<p>Most tour groups from Surabaya stay overnight at Tretes, where there are a number of hotels, as there are in Malang, which has the added advantage of having an airport. Alternatively, you can also contact a travel agency to arrange your trip.</p>\n<h2>Get Around</h2>\n<p>Many visitors choose to walk while they arrive at the park. There are clearly marked tracks across the sand sea that leads to the foot of Mount Bromo. Alternatively, you can rent a jeep or hire a horse from Cemoro Lawang to get around.<br/>\n</p>\n<h2>Attraction</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Outdoor Activities</b></p>\n<p><img alt=\"bromo\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/bromo22.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p><i>Image by furstset</i></p>\n<p>Tengger sand sea with its 5.250 hectares area will make a perfect place to walk around or ride a horse and feel like a wild west cowboy. You can also hike to the top of Mount Bromo or, if you feel challenged enough, to the summit of Mount Semeru, which is the highest mountain in the land of Java. For other options, you can watch the beautiful sunrise from Ranu Kumbolo, where the sun will slowly emerge from the valley between the two hills something just like a fairytale. You can also visit the nearby waterfalls such as Madakaripura, Coban Sewu, Coban Pelangi, and Coban Jahe waterfalls.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>Religious Tourism</b></p>\n<p><img alt=\"bromo\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/bromo3.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Most of <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/event-festivals/yadnya-kasada-and-bromo-excotica-festival-on-bewitching-mt-bromo.html\">Tengger</a> natives embrace Hindu teachings as their religion. Therefore, there are a number of Hindu temples around Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. You can visit Kidal Temple, Luhur Poten Temple, Mandara Giri Semeru Agung Temple, and Jago Temple to marvel at the historical magnificence.</p>\n<p><b>Signature Experience</b></p>\n<p>Besides all the natural wonders, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park also has its own cultural charm. <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/ngadas-a-serene-village-above-the-clouds-at-mt-bromo-east-java.html\">Ngadas</a>, a serene village up on the slopes of Mt. Bromo, will be a fun thing to not be missed. Situated in the highlands only 6,5 KM away from the majestic Mt. Bromo, the average temperature is around 0 - 25 degrees Celsius, with cool to relatively cold refreshing air. The villagers, which mainly consist of Tengger natives, still practice the ancient rituals and ceremonies that are believed to bring order, good fortune, and prosperity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Delegations were headed by legendary leaders that included Jawaharlal Nehru and daughter Indira Gandhi, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Prime Minister Zhou En Lai of China and of course Indonesia's own President Soekarno, and many, many more.</p>\n<p>But back in Dutch colonial days, at the beginning of the 20th century, Bandung was the favorite resort of wealthy tea and coffee planters owners of swathes of undulating tea and <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/15-stylish-spots-with-great-coffee-for-your-holiday-in-bandung.html\">coffee plantations</a>.
