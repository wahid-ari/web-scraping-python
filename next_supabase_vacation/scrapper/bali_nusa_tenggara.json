Situated some 10 km from Denpasar, capital city of Bali, Seminyak stretches from Double Six Street in the south and morphs into the villages of Kerobokan and Umalas, north of Petitenget Temple. Although it may be somewhat difficult to stipulate where precisely Kuta, Legian or Seminyak begin or end, one thing is clear: Seminyak is certainly in a class all its own. The atmosphere here is much more sophisticated and laid-back compared to Kuta, while the beach in particular is relatively quiet during the day.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Seminyak\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/seminyak/seminyak-1.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Seminyak is also a great start if you are planning to explore Bali\u2019s lush landscapes and cultural gems, from Uluwatu Temple in the south and Tanah Lot Temple to the north, to the stunning rice terraces that stretch as wide as the eye can see. Seminyak also has an abundance of budget hostels and high-end resorts so you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about looking for the right place to stay. Needless to say, it\u2019s everything you could want in one perfect Balinese getaway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Get There</h3>\n<p>Seminyak is part of the main west coast conurbation in South Bali and traffic can get very congested at times. The easiest way to get there from Ngurah Rai International Airport would be starting from Kuta and Legian. The Legian Street runs parallel with the beach, and at its western limit continues as Seminyak Street. You can also get to Seminyak via the eastern bypass of Sunset Street. This is almost invariably the quicker route from Kuta and Legian into Seminyak, although it is actually further distance-wise.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Seminyak\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/seminyak/seminyak-2.jpg\" width=\"500\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>There are many hotels that provide shuttle services from and to Seminyak. A prepaid taxi from the airport to Seminyak costs approximately around the rate of IDR 60,000. Trips to or from Kuta cost around IDR 30,000 and from Legian about IDR 15,000.<br/>\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Get Around</h3>\n<p>There is no better way to explore every inch of Seminyak than going for a walk. While the nights are offering cool breeze, walking will be the best option. Otherwise, when the sun is too hot, or you plan to go far, then you can simply catch a taxi. If you\u2019re staying at a mid-range hotel or high-end resort, you can ask your concierge for a shuttle or private car.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a bit more adventure and feel confident about exploring on your own, then renting a motorbike for a small fee is the Bali way of life!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

    "content": "<h1>Kupang on Timor</h1><p class=\"fs-6 border-top fw-light\">\n<p>During World War II, the city of Kupang, formerly known as Koepang, on the island of Timor, was the hub for refueling and landing for long-haul flights from Europe to Australia. The historical El Tari airstrip that was first landed by an American pilot, Lamij Johnson, in 1928 holds many stories, more than being a mere transit lounge and fuel depot for the few fliers back then. Today, when visitors step on to the modernizing city, one can still find traces of Dutch occupation as well as a Portuguese inherited aura. For since long before Indonesia\u2019s Independence, Timor\u2019s western part had been colonized by the Dutch while the islands eastern part by the Portuguese. This division originated from the time when these two powers fought for hegemony in the lucrative spice trade.</p>\n<p>Today, Kupang is the capital city of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, perched in the southwestern part of Timor Island. As one of the three largest islands in East Nusa Tenggara (comprising Sumba, Flores and Timor), Timor island is now shared by two independent countries. The island\u2019s eastern part being the newly independent East Timor \u2013 or Timor Leste, while the island\u2019s western part is Indonesian territory. Its favorable position in the south-eastern most part of Indonesia, has made the city of Kupang into the first port of entry in Indonesian waters from Australia, if not yet as a tourist destination in its own right.</p>\n<p>The Nusa Tenggara is a string of islands to the east of Bali, while Timor is its easternmost island in that string. Topographically, Timor differs from the rest of the East Nusa Tenggara islands. For the line of volcanoes that runs from Sumatra, Java, and on to other Nusa Tenggara islands, skips Timor and continues north to Maluku or the Moluccas. The cause of this is that unlike other Nusa Tenggara islands, Timor is in fact geologically related to Australia, and therefore has no volcanoes. While it geographical location and long history and tradition make it culturally Indonesian.</p>\n<p>Being closest than any Indonesian cities to the marinas of Australian yachts in Darwin, the lighthouse at the seaport of Kupang stands as the first milepost for participating yachtsmen in the annual Sail Indonesia event. Each year, hundreds of yachts cross the open seas from Darwin, Australia sailing to Kupang, and from here to visit many known as well as remote Indonesian islands, to finally dock in Singapore. The annual Sail Indonesia has brought the name of Koepang to the fore, recalling its fame in the early twentieth century.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndonesians laugh a lot\u201d, said Prooke of Marlborough, UK. It\u2019s the land of laughs and smiles.</p>\n<p>People in Timor are friendly. They love to laugh as do most Indonesians on the whole. Traditionally, people in Kupang and West Timor were distinguished by their social positions. The nobility here used to be called Amaf, the rulers Atupas, the commons Too, and slaves Ata. Today, ata no longer exist. Each of the social class had its own role to play in society. Yet, these classes share a mutual sentiment when it comes to tradition. The root of its heritage is so deep, making it difficult to trace. These deep rooted traditions even persisted through centuries of teachings of newer religions that were brought by traders or colonial rulers.</p>\n<p>Look at the motives and patterns of their woven cloths called tenun ikat, and one can sense its age old heritage. Tenun ikat is the local craftsmanship in producing beautifully and sometimes mysteriously formed patterns on traditionally woven fabrics. Not only are the people proud of these cloths, but all Indonesians share the pride that these cloths are one of Indonesia\u2019s most precious tangible national heritage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Get There</b></p>\n<p>Kupang is accessible by plane or ferries. Its historical airport, El Tari was formerly known as Penfui airstrip, having first served an American pilot, Lamij Johnson, in 1928. Penfui literally means \u2018bush of cornfields\u2019, since the airstrip\u2019s surroundings were heavily covered with cornfields. El Tari connects western Timor Island with other large cities in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Home to over a hundred species of wildlife, the national park is best known as the sanctuary of the <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/west-bali-national-park/bali-starling-songbird.html\" target=\"_blank\">exotic white Bali Starling</a></u> , an endemic iconic bird of the island of the gods.</p>\n<p>Located in the most north-westerly point of Bali, the national park includes the whole area of the Prapat Agung Peninsula, and large swathes of land around the towns of Gilimanuk, Cekik and Banyuwedang which lie in the regencies of Jembrana and Buleleng. This national park is approximately 100Km from Bali\u2019s capital city, <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/denpasar.html\" target=\"_blank\">Denpasar,</a></u> or about 50 km west from the northern city of Singaraja, capital of Buleleng regency.</p>\n<p>West Bali National Park has a total area of 19,002.89 hectares, covering 15,587.89 hectares of land and 3,415 hectares of water. The habitat is very varied with rainforests, dry savannas, acacia scrubs and lowland forests, as well as more montane forests in the higher region. There are also some pockets of dense mangrove forests. In the north of the park is an obvious north jutting peninsula called Prapat Agung. Around this peninsula are long stretches of protected beach and offshore coral reefs as well as a small offshore island called <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/menjangan-island.html\" target=\"_blank\">Menjangan</a></u> . The latter is a very popular diving destination.</p>\n<p>One hundred and sixty species of birds have been recorded in the park, including the near extinct Bali Starling (<i>Leucopsar rothschildi</i>), Bali's only endemic vertebrate species,the fauna icon of Bali. It was the key reason why this national park was created in 1941. By 2001, it was estimated that as few as only six individual starlings were thought to have survived in the wild, all of them in this park. Since then, captive breeding and re-introduction efforts have continued apace, but poaching pressures remain a large problem. With that in mind, a second re-introduction program was started in the remote regions of Nusa Penida, off the coast of Sanur Beach in 2004. In June 2011, West Bali National Park received 60 endangered Bali Starling for release, 40 from the <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/surabaya.html\" target=\"_blank\">Surabaya</a></u> Zoo and 20 from <a href=\"http://202.72.206.26:4502/content/indtravelrevamp/id/en/destinations/java/bogor/taman-safari.html\" target=\"Target\"><u>Taman Safari</u> Indonesia</a> . Keen birdwatchers can find a checklist of likely species and their status here.</p>\n<p>Among some other fauna found in the National park are: the Wild Bull ( <i>Banteng</i>), Barn Swallow, Black-naped Oriole, Black Racket-tailed Treepie, Crested Serpent-eagle, Crested Treeswift, Dollarbird, Hawksbill Turtle, Indian Muntjac, Java Sparrow, Javan macaque (<i>Lutung</i>), Large Flying Fox, Leopard Cat, Lesser Adjutant, Long-tailed Shrike, Milky Stork, Pacific Swallow, Red-rumped Swallow, <i>Menjangan</i> Wild Deer, Sacred Kingfisher, Savanna Nightjar, Stork-billed Kingfisher, Water Monitor, Wild Boar, Yellow-vented Bulbul, and many more.</p>\n<p>The national park is also the home of several endangered species of flora such as: <i>Pterospermum diversifolium, Antidesma bunius, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Steleochocarpus burahol, Santalum album, Aleuritas moluccana, Sterculia foetida, Schleichera oleosa, Dipterocarpus hasseltii, Garcinia dulcis, Alstonia scholaris, Manilkara kauki, Dalbergia latifolia</i> <i></i> and<i> Cassia fistula</i>.</p>\n<p>The Marine reserve includes the cape shores and several sanctuary islands with many seabirds in the bay of Gilimanuk, on the island of Menjangan and the excellent coral reefs surrounding it. The good drop-offs on Menjangan's south side are only surpassed by the particularly superb reefs on its northern shores. The island is a popular spot for locals and tourists wishing to dive for a variety of fish and coral reef exploration. There are no dangerous currents to contend with in this area.</p>\n<p>West Bali Barat National Park also shows high bio-diversity in a relatively small marine area. At the end of the last century, 110 species of corals belonging to 18 families were recorded, of which 22 species were of the mushroom coral family (there are only 29 species of mushroom corals recorded worldwide), and there were at least 27 species of <i>Acropora</i> coral found in a relatively small area of only 2 hectares.</p>\n<p>With all the splendors that stretch from the heart of its thick jungle to the deep waters that surround the peninsula, West Bali National Park is truly a natural treasure of the fabled island of Bali.</p>\n<p>For permit and information please contact:</p>\n<p>West Bali National Park Head Office:</p>\n<p>Balai Taman Nasional Bali Barat</p>\n<p>Jl.

Tanah Lot means Land in The Sea, a perfectly fit name for its unique offshore settings. The silhouette of Pura Tanah Lot is one of the most popular iconic features of Bali.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Magnificent Balinese Temple in the Open Ocean\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/tanahlot.jpg\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>Imagine the image of a Balinese temple (pura) perched high on the rock, facing the wide open ocean. With the crashing waves below and the dramatic colors of the dusk sky as background, lit by the slowly disappearing sun. Tanah Lot is located in Tabanan, only around 30 km away from Denpasar. The temple is located some 300 meters offshore. The history of Tanah Lot temple was believed to date back to the 16th century, by Dang Hyang Nirartha, a respected religious figure in Bali.</p>\n<p>Dang Hyang Nirartha was said to be the one who created a three-temple system in Balinese villages. Setting the site plan that the temple built in the northern area of the village would be for Brahma, middle area for Vishnu and the southern side for Shiva. While traveling along the southern coast of Bali, he saw the little rock-island and decided to spend the night. The rock was known as Gili Beo, which means a bird-shaped rock, located in Beraban village. He then felt an enlightenment, that this was a holy place to build a shrine. The leader of Beraban was angry and order people to banish Nirartha from Gili Beo.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Magnificent Balinese Temple in the Open Ocean\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/tanahlot1.jpg\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>In Balinese mythology, Dang Hyang Nirartha was known as a man of mighty supernatural power. So he moves the whole rock island to the sea, builds a temple and named it Tanah Lot. The whole Beraban village were astounded and later join to follow he believes. Tanah Lot temple was built to worship Bhatara Segara, or the sea God. To protect the temple, with his mighty power, he created a poisonous snake from his sash. The sea snake is believed to be living at the base of this rocky island, to guard the temple from evil intruders.<br/>\r\nToday, as one of the most photographed sea temple in Bali, you will find many art shops offering local handicrafts besides other signature local products at the entrance to get to Tanah Lot.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Magnificent Balinese Temple in the Open Ocean\" src=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/sajen.jpg\"><br/>\n</img></p>\n<p>The best time to visit Tanah Lot is during Odalan, which is celebrated every 210 days.
