A masterful* intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far—a book about the power of storytelling* starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in Mr. Mercedes“Wake up* genius. ” So begins King’s instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein* an iconic author who created a famous character* Jimmy Gold* but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid* not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books* but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash* yes* but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel. Morris hides the money and the notebooks* and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later* a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure* and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges* Holly Gibney* and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years. Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular* heart-pounding suspense* but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life—for good* for bad* forever. , https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King, https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg, Portland* Maine* The United States, http://www.stephenking.com, Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.

Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith* guilt and fear* helplessness and survival* the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. In "Redeployment"* a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia* surrounded by people "who have no idea where Fallujah is* where three members of your platoon died. " In "After Action Report"* a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit* in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U. S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity* and his ability to provide solace through religion* tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic "Money as a Weapons System"* a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony* bureaucracy* comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war* and the isolation* remorse* and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents* Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth* this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation. , https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7114556.Phil_Klay, https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1601311798p5/7114556.jpg, The United Kingdom, http://www.philklay.com, Phil Klay is a veteran of the US Marine Corps.
